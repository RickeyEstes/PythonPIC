* do my particles EVER slow down? kinetic energy seems to be going infinite
    * neutralizing background? I'm zeroing the rho_F[0] component, but is that enough?
* particle pusher tests
* test cases for fourier energy!
* see if half frequency calculation of energy is correct with current setup

optimalizations:
* try numpy.fft instead of scipy.fftpack
* use pycuda for particles
