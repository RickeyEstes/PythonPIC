    the Poisson equation can be written either as

    $$\nabla^2 V = -\rho/\epsilon_0$$

    Assuming that all functions in fourier space can be represented as
    $$\exp{i(kx - \omega t)}$$
    It is easy to see that upon Fourier transformation $\nabla \to ik$, so

    (in fourier space)
    $$E = \rho /(ik \epsilon_0)$$
    $$V = \rho / (-k^2 \epsilon_0)$$

    Calculate that, fourier transform back to position space
    and both the field and potential pop out easily

    The conceptually problematic part is getting the $k$ wave vector right
